{"pageProps":{"id":"math_pixelwise","description":"Image processing or massive data manipulation problems may require simple math operations with 2 operands. There are several GammaCV operations that make it possible to be powered by GPU using WebGL in the browser: gm.sub, gm.add, gm.div, gm.mult. These chainable operations could help in achieving image diff (via Sub op), parallel (like a SIMD) numbers manipulation."},"__N_SSG":true}
