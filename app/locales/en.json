      "text": "We created GammaCV to make it easy to integrate Computer Vision in modern web applications. GammaCV was built with a similar architecture to TensorFlow, in particular, it also uses a data flow paradigm to create and run graphs on GPU, this enables the robust image processing and feature extraction capability of the library."
