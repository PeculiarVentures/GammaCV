# Get Started

The library is a high-level abstraction API to create and run operations on different backends (WebGL, WASM, JS). GammaCV also enables you to construct operation graphs and control the flow of execution.

## Installation
To use GammaCV you first need to install it. 
To install the latest stable version run:
`npm install gammacv --save`

## Core Concepts
To use GammaCV, you need to understand three core concepts: tensors, operations, and sessions. The basic unit of this library is a tensor. `Tensor` allows you to create N-dimensional vector and store it in memory using TypedArrays. The second part of the library is an operation. `Operation` under the hood is graph node which will have multiple inputs and always produce a single output. The third component is a session. `Session` is a runtime which allows you to run computational graphs on different backends with the same API. For a better understanding of how it works let's create a simple program and run it on the GPU using WebGL:

## Chaining / Pipelining operations
For real world applications, you'll often need to combine multiple operations in sequence. With GammaCV this is as easy as creating a pipeline. This is just a semantic nuance, if you've followed the example above, you've already created one.
