Main:
  Title: GammaCV is a WebGL accelerated Computer Vision library for modern web applications.
  Description: We created GammaCV to make it easy to integrate Computer Vision in modern web applications. GammaCV was built with a similar architecture to TensorFlow, in particular, it also uses a data flow paradigm to create and run graphs on GPU, this enables the robust image processing and feature extraction capability of the library.

    Descriptions:
      compact: Weighing in at only 87.5k uncompressed and 32.5k compressed GammaCV is small enough to be used in your Progressive Web Application without weighing it down.
      fast: Many computer vision libraries make the typical laptop sound like it is about to take off like a jet plane. Not GammaCV, our use of WebGL enables fast frame rates without consuming all of the users CPU resources. 
      cross_platform: We did the work so you don't have to. All of the capabilities offered by GammaCV have been tested to work reliably in all modern browsers on desktop, mobiles and tablets.
