GammaCV was built with a similar architecture to TensorFlow, in particular, it also uses a data flow paradigm to create and run graphs on GPU, this enables the robust image processing and feature extraction capability of the library.",Advantages:{Titles:{compact:"Compact",fast:"Fast",cross_platform:"Cross Platform",_:"{context}"},Descriptions:{compact:"Weighing in at only 87.5k uncompressed and 32.5k compressed GammaCV is small enough to be used in your Progressive Web Application without weighing it down.",fast:"Many computer vision libraries make the typical laptop sound like it is about to take off like a jet plane. Not GammaCV, our use of WebGL enables fast frame rates without consuming all of the users CPU resources.",cross_platform:"We did the work so you don't have to.
